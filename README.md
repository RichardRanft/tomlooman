## Unreal Engine C++ Tutorial Projects

You can find all my blogs and tutorials over at **[tomlooman.com](https://tomlooman.com)**. I have a ton of C++ and material focused tutorials and learning resources.

### Unreal Engine C++ Pro Course

In 2020 I taught a full curriculum at Stanford University for Unreal Engine C++. You can now enroll in this course yourself using the links below.

**[Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp?coupon_code=COMMUNITY15&src=github)**

The C++ Course features include building of a C++ game framework including an "action system" and event-driven code for flexible and re-usable game code the "unreal way". Multiplayer features, AI bots, SaveGame system, async loading of content, UMG menus and UI and so much more!

### Action Roguelike (Unreal Engine C++ Pro Course)

This project is part of the **[Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp?coupon_code=COMMUNITY15&src=github)** Course where we build this project step-by-step.
